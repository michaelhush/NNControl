14 - 18 Aug:
NN_Control_algorithm.py:
1) Model class: allow users to define multiple dynamics. But need to follow function names. See code comments.
2) Separate main scripts from class
3) saving values pickling, saving trained NN models (Adam solver??)
4) forget data history
5) starting iterations at last values
- all trainable variable values unchanged between iterations
- only need to record last cell states and hidden states 
- Last state values are obtained by feeding the last batch data
- Not sure about the last state values for plotting (useful if you want to see how much better controller does each iteration)
